                Code.org easily shows <i>Visual Heirarchy</i> with the choice of
                varying font sizes they use for their content. This section on 
                the site specifically shows what they deem to be important information
                for the viewer to see. They want to emphisize why they are a great place
                for people to learn how to code, and draw the viewers attention to the 
                staggering numbers they present by making that the first thing they see
                when they get to this part on the site.

            <p>
                343 did a great job with showing the example of <i>Repetition</i>. They 
                chose to put up a familiar feel as you go through the whole site to make
                it easy to navigate and look at. As you can see from the screen shot, the 
                entire home page is basically put in this "square filled with info by square"
                format as they go through and list information about their company.

            <h3>WHITE SPACE & CLEAN DESIGN</h3>

            <p>
                Nike is literally built upon the design principle of <i>White Space and Clean Design</i>.
                Their whole branding is about making clean and pleasing to the eye content, and as 
                you can see from the screenshot, they use their whitespace to make the webpage feel
                almost as one flowing image that you are looking at. When I look at this website the first
                thing that comes to mind is balance. Everything feels really simple, elegent, and makes the 
                viewer feel like they are looking at a polished site.
